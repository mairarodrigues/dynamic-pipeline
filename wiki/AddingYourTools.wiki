#How to add your own tools to the dynamic pipeline system.

= Introduction =

To use the dynamic pipeline system you must add your own tools to the system. These tools are the ones to be considered for pipeline generation. It is recommended that your tools are, in some degree, compatible in terms of inputs and outputs, so that their combination in a pipeline is possible.

To add your tools to the dynamic pipeline system you will need to:
 # populate the folder "tools/" with the tools you want to include in your pipeline system; and
 # instantiate the Tool Registry (registry/ToolRegistry.txt) with information about those tools. 

= The Tool Registry =

All information about the tools that are part of the pipeline system is stored in a data structure called Tool Registry (the registry/ToolRegistry.txt file). Each entry on the registry describes a particular tool with the following attributes:
 * the input that it accepts (Input), which can be a file type or format; 
 * the output that it generates (Output), that can also be a file type or format; 
 * its executable name (Tool); 
 * its programming language (Language); 
 * an identification number (Code); 
 * a list of extra input files required to run it (XI or input dependencies); 
 * a list of secondary output files generated by the tool (XO or subproducts); 
 * a performance measure indicating its average execution time (Performance); 
 * free text observations that the tool provider thinks the user must know in order to run it (Observations);  
 * the provider's name (Provider); and
 * the provider's contact (Contact).

Example:
