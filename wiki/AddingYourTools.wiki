#How to add your own tools to the dynamic pipeline system.

= Introduction =

To use the dynamic pipeline system you must add your own tools to the system. These tools are the ones to be considered for pipeline generation. It is recommended that your tools are, in some degree, compatible in terms of inputs and outputs, so that their combination in a pipeline is possible.

To add your tools to the dynamic pipeline system you will need to:
 # populate the folder "tools/" with the tools you want to include in your pipeline system; and
 # instantiate the Tool Registry (`registry/ToolRegistry.txt`) with information about those tools. 

= The Tool Registry =

All information about the tools that are part of the pipeline system is stored in a data structure called Tool Registry (the `registry/ToolRegistry.txt` file). Each entry on the registry describes a particular tool with the following attributes:
 * the input that it accepts (Input), which can be a file type or format; 
 * the output that it generates (Output), that can also be a file type or format; 
 * its executable name (Tool); 
 * its programming language (Language); 
 * an identification number (Code); 
 * a list of extra input files required to run it (XI or input dependencies); 
 * a list of secondary output files generated by the tool (XO or subproducts); 
 * a performance measure indicating its average execution time (Performance); 
 * free text observations that the tool provider thinks the user must know in order to run it (Observations);  
 * the provider's name (Provider); and
 * the provider's contact (Contact).

Example:
||#INPUT||OUTPUT ||TOOL||LANGUAGE||CODE||DEPENDENCIES||SUBPRODUCTS||PERFORMANCE||OBSERVATIONS||PROVIDER||CONTACT||
||!FileType1||!FileType2 ||toolx.pl||Perl||01||!FileType3||-||0.25||-||John Smith||john@mail||

This entry describes a tool `toolx.pl` writen in `Perl` that performs some processing on `FileType1` and generates `FileType2`, and requires an extra input file `FileType3`. Its performance measure is `0.25` (see the Section Performance Measure on how to determine it).

==Performance Measure==

The performance measure indicates the time that the tool takes to finish its execution. It is used to identify the fastest pipeline, in case there are alternative pipelines for the same task. 

It can be measured in any time unit (hours, minutes, seconds, miliseconds). You should chose one time unit and use the same unit for all measures. In the example above, the performance measure of `toolx.pl` indicates that it takes `0.25` seconds to process inputs `FileType1` and `FileType3` and generate `FileType2`.

Since tools are invoked by the command line, we suggest that you use the unix `time` command to evaluate your tools. 

*Note:* you should use the same time unit for all measures and the same or similar input files, when possible (same size or same amount of information). That is, if you evaluate alternative tools with input files of different sizes the measure will be biased. 

=Standards for each Tool=

Each tool in the pipeline (folder "`/tools`") is invoked by a command line call with the following format: 
{{{
<programing language call> <tool executable name> <input file 1> [input file n] <output file 1> [output file n]
}}}
where squared brackets represent optional parameters (that is, in case a tool requires extra inputs or generates secondary output files).
