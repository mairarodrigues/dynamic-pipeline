#summary Instructions for running the dynamic pipeline algorithm.

= Introduction =

So far, in the dynamic pipeline project we provide three files: the dynamic pipeline algorithm written in Java, a sample tool registry file in xml, and a sample interface program written in PHP. Requirements for using these files are below. 


= Requirements for the Java Algorithm =

  * Library jgrapht-0.8.1

  * Directory hierarchy (required beforehand):

  dynamicpipeline/java/

  dynamicpipeline/java/jgrapht-0.8.1/  

  dynamicpipeline/registry/

  dynamicpipeline/scripts/

  All with read+exec permissions

  * Directory hierarchy (created on execution):
  dynamicpipeline/inputs/
  dynamicpipeline/pipelines/  
  
  All with read+exec+write permissions

  * Complementary files:
  scripts.txt (on dynamicpipeline/registry/)
 
  With read+exec+write permission


= Requirements for the PHP Interface =

  * Configure index.php classpath with absolute path:

  "/xxx/dynamicpipeline/java/jgrapht-0.8.1/jgrapht-jdk1.6.jar:/xxx/dynamicpipeline/java/"
