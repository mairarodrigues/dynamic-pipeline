#summary Sample tool registry - How to use.

= The Tool Registry =
-----------------

We provide a sample tool registry at `registry/` so that you can run the algorithms in the java programs.
However, you will not be able to run the pipelines that are generated by the main algorithm (`SetPipelines.class`) since the composing tools are not in the system (folder `tools/`).

In order to run the pipelines that are generated you will need to create a new tool registry with your own tools and place these tools in `tools/`.
